Password Manager is a Flask app that allows the user to securely store personal data, such as passwords, notes, and credit card info. All user data is encrypted, and the user can choose to use OTP two-factor authentication. The user can export and import their encrypted account data. The user can also decrypt it within the app without the need to log in (as long as they have their master password).

Users can also use [command-line client](https://github.com/pete-sk/password-manager-cmd-client) to access their data via API.

This app also includes a simple blog for product updates.
